# Getting Started: Designing a CraftOS standard

If you're reading this, you would probably like to propose a new standard to be accepted by the [ComputerCraft](http://computercraft.info) community. If you follow this guide to the point and eventually get your standard accepted, your proposal will rest in this repository *forever*, and might even [get recommended](ToDo:Point this somewhere) and adopted by many CraftOS developers. Is that not what every programmer wishes for? Let's get you started!

### Step 1: Your Idea
You can't spell "your proposal" without "you". You are the person who will be in charge of creating and maintaining the proposal, at least to the point where it gets rejected or accepted. For that, you should have an idea of what do you want to be standardized, how, and why. If you haven't decided on these points yet, chances are that you aren't ready to propose anything, this step cannot be skipped.

### Step 2: Documentation
Already sure how should the final result look like? Great! You can start writing the docs for your upcoming standard. Make sure not to create a Pull Request ("PR") yet, as at this point your proposal doesn't yet match the [required template](./StandardProposalGuidelines.md).
