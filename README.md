# CraftOS Standards

*Community standard file formats, communication systems, etc. for ComputerCraft and CraftOS 2.0*

If you're developing a program for ComputerCraft or CraftOS 2.0 it is highly recommended to adopt the systems standardised here. It allows for cross-program compatibility and formats/systems that are well thought out.

**Watch this space!** It's probably a good idea to Watch this repository so you are notified when a new standard is proposed.

## How to Contribute

If you have a standard you would like to propose follow these steps:

1. **Make sure there isn't an existing standard** – the whole point of this repo is to ensure we don't have two [slightly different standards](https://xkcd.com/927/); there should only be one.
2. **Develop your standard** – think about the different use cases and try to create clearly defined standards and rules for your standard. If applicable, it's probably a good idea to create an API or example code for your standard.
3. **Write an RFC** – once you have created your standard create a Markdown document which clearly explains what your standard is, how it works and how to use it. If you're at all unsure of what to do, look at the RFCs of accepted standards.
4. **Create a pull request** – create a pull request with your completed Markdown file. If you think it belongs in a folder put it in there/create it, but we can easily move it if you're unsure. Any code examples should be embedded in the Markdown file. Your pull request's description should be a explanation of the format and why it's needed, but not too descriptive, that's what the Markdown file is for. Remember that the pull request isn't permanent, it is there to agree upon the standard, the Markdown file is permanent and should have all the detail. However, any full APIs should be uploaded to Pastebin and a link should be added to the Markdown file. *There should be no code files in the repo, markdown only.*
5. **Post a link on the forums** – not everyone pays attention to GitHub. To allow more people to see your RFC create a topic in general directing them to the pull request. The post should simply give a very brief description of what your standard is (i.e. *an method redirecting a terminal over Rednet*). The post's title should also make it pretty obvious it's an RFC (i.e. *RFC: TRoR (Terminal Redirection over Rednet)*). To keep everything centralised it's best to keep discussion of the RFC on the pull request, *NOT* the forums post.
6. **Discussion** – if anyone has any issues or improvements with your standard discuss them on the pull request and change the RFC's markdown file until people have agreed upon the standard. At this point the pull request will be merged, you standard has been accepted!

If you think a pull request should already have been merged @ mention one of the moderators (see below).
