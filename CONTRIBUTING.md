## Guidelines for Contributing to CraftOS-Standards
Welcome, fellow developer! First off, make yourself familiar with the [tutorial](./Tutorial/GettingStarted.md). It's a long read, so enjoy it with some :coffee:. If you'd like to create new standards, the tutorial should actually give you all that you'll need to know. Thanks for helping us out by standardizing something awesome!

If, for some reason, you'd like to join our amazing [contributor team](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/graphs/contributors), you will need to know a few more things about how this repository works. Great news! We wrote them down here so that you won't have to bother us about the details.

### Repository Organization
[Contributors](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/graphs/contributors) take care of everything, and are also the mods of our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/oeed/CraftOS-Standards). As a contributor, you will assign [labels](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/labels) to [Issues](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/issues?q=is%3Aopen), help users who are proposing a standard with their [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) documentation (as in, help them make it follow [the template](./Tutorial/StandardProposalGuidelines.md)) and watch out for new [pull requests](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/pulls) that pop up every day. When on [Gitter](https://gitter.im), you will be in charge of keeping the conversation on-topic. You will also provide help to users asking for it.

If you really want to become a contributor, here is a checklist of what you need to do before asking @oeed to add you to [the team](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/graphs/contributors):
- [ ] Make sure you are a [Markdown master](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [ ] You really have to know the [guide](./Tutorial/GettingStarted.md) by heart. Read the [README](./README.md) as well
- [ ] Watch this repository 
- [ ] Look at some of the [accepted PRs](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/issues?q=label%3Aaccepted+-label%3Ameta) to see what a perfect proposal looks like
