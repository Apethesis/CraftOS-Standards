# Guidelines for Contributing to CraftOS-Standards

Welcome, fellow developer! First off, make yourself familiar with the [tutorial](./Tutorial/GettingStarted.md). It's a
long read, so enjoy it with some :coffee:. If you'd like to create new standards, the tutorial should actually give you
all that you'll need to know. Thanks for helping us out by standardizing something awesome!

### A Note on Licensing
All standards published here on CraftOS-Standards are licensed under
the [GNU Free Documentation License](../LICENSE.md). **This includes all code examples**. For the sake of open source
software and simplicity alike, libraries for dealing with your standard should also be licensed
under [similar FOSS licenses](http://choosealicense.com/). After all, licensing official utilities for an open source
standard under a closed source license wouldn't make much sense.

## Getting Started: Becoming a CraftOS-Standards Contributor

If, for some reason, you'd like to join our
amazing [contributor team](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/graphs/contributors), you will need to know a few
more things about how this repository works. Great news! We wrote them down here so that you won't have to bother us
about the details.

### Repository Organization

[Contributors](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/graphs/contributors) take care of everything, and are also the
mods of our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/oeed/CraftOS-Standards). As a contributor, you will
assign [labels](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/labels)
to [Issues](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/issues?q=is%3Aopen), help users who are proposing a standard with
their [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) documentation (as in, help them make it
follow [the template](./Tutorial/StandardProposalGuidelines.md)) and watch out for
new [pull requests](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/pulls) that pop up every day. When
on [Gitter](https://gitter.im), you will be in charge of keeping the conversation on-topic. You will also provide help
to users asking for it.

If you really want to become a contributor, here is a checklist of what you need to do before asking @oeed to add you
to [the team](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/graphs/contributors) as a collaborator:
 - [ ] Make sure you are a [Markdown master](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
 - [ ] You really have to know the [guide](./Tutorial/GettingStarted.md) by heart. Read the [README](./README.md) as
   well
 - [ ] Watch this repository
 - [ ] Look at some of
   the [accepted PRs](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/issues?q=label%3Aaccepted+-label%3Ameta) to see what a
   perfect proposal looks like
 - [ ] Look at some of
   the [rejected PRs](https://github.com/oeed/CraftOS-Standards/issues?q=label%3Arejected+-label%3Ameta) as well, to see
   what we *don't* want to see here. If you'll become a contributor, chances are that you'll meet a lot of similar pull
   requests!
 - [ ] Feel free to discuss any issues and PRs even if you aren't a contributor (yet)!

We try hard to stick to the ["Successful git Branching Model"](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/),
which means that major changes happen off the (default) `master` branch.
